# Configuration

To use [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) devices with the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem, you will need to configure at least one connector.
The connector can be configured using the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) user interface or through the console.

There are two types of connectors available for selection:

- **Local** - This connector uses the local network for communication.
- **Cloud** - This connector communicates with the [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) cloud instance.

## Setting Up Tuya Devices

Before using the Tuya connector, you will need to pair your Tuya devices with the Tuya cloud platform and mobile app.
Refer to your device's manual for instructions on how to do this.

## Obtaining Tuya Access Credentials

In order to use the Tuya connector, you will need to obtain certain access credentials.
These can be obtained by following these steps:

### Creating a Tuya Developer Account

To get started, go to [iot.tuya.com](https://iot.tuya.com) and either create a new account or log in if you already have one. Note that this
account is different from the account you use for the Tuya mobile app.
