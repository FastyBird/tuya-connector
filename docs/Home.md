The [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) Tuya Connector is an extension for the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem that enables seamless integration
with [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) devices. It allows users to easily connect and control [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) devices from within the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem,
providing a simple and user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring your devices.

# Naming Convention

The connector uses the following naming convention for its entities:

## Connector

A connector is an entity that manages communication with [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) devices. It needs to be configured for a specific device interface.

## Device

A device is an entity that represents a physical [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) device.

## DPS - Data Points

The Tuya devices transmit information, referred to as "data points" (DPS) or "device function points," in a JSON string format.
These DPS attributes determine the state of the device. The keys within the DPS dictionary correspond to key-value pairs,
where the key is the DP ID and its value is the dpValue.

# Configuration

To use [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) devices with the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem, you will need to configure at least one connector.
The connector can be configured using the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) user interface or through the console.

There are two types of connectors available for selection:

- **Local** - This connector uses the local network for communication.
- **Cloud** - This connector communicates with the [Tuya](https://www.tuya.com) cloud instance.

## Setting Up Tuya Devices

Before using the Tuya connector, you will need to pair your Tuya devices with the Tuya cloud platform and mobile app.
Refer to your device's manual for instructions on how to do this.

## Obtaining Tuya Access Credentials

+----+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+
 [OK] Devices discovery was successfully finished
```

Now that all newly discovered devices have been found, they are available in the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) system and can be utilized.

# Known Issues and Limitations

## Mapping DPS to Properties

When using local network mode for device discovery, the connector may not always be able to accurately detect the data
types of each device's DPS (data points). In such cases, it may be necessary to manually edit the device's properties
and correct their configurations.
